/*# Welcome to Recursion Land!
#
# The task is to build a binary tree using a breadth first insertion method,
# and then print out a depth first traversal of the values:
#
# - Values to be inserted are '1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15'
# - After insertion, the start of your tree should look like this...
#               1
#         ------|------
#         |           |
#         2           3
#      ---|---     ---|---
#      |     |     |     |
#      4     5     6     7
#
# ...and so on
#
# - A depth first traversal should print one value per line.
